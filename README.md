# VBA-challenge
The VBA script for this file is based on the codes provided by the in-class assignments of the U of T Data Analysis bootcamp.  ChaGPT was also used in the assistance of debugging and code clean up.  
The purpose of this file is to loop through all the stocks for one year and output information for each ticker symbol.  This information included the "yearly change", :the percentage change", and "the total volume of the stock".  This summary of information is then used to provide the "greatest % increase", "greatest % decrease", and "greatest total volume".  Finally, conditional formatting is utilized to make it user friendly.
